# Cracker-Toolkit-Python3
This is a toolkit for crackers written mainly in Python 3.

There is a README.md file in each module that gives examples for each of the tools. The manual is in each file. For E-Books, the introduction of each book is written in the README file in the dictionary, please check them out and decide what are you going to read before downloading them.

I will be creating the wiki later. But for now, I will write the manual in each module.
